Today, we are going to look at building page layouts with React Router 4. If you’ve switched to it, you would find that a lot of the code you used with Router 3 doesn’t really work, and a lot of the answers on Stack Overflow refer to older version. A webpage usually has common elements such as the top bar where the user can log in/out, the footer etc. Since the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle tells us not to duplicate code, you obviously don't want to copy paste the common parts of the layout in every page of your website you are building.

If you come from .NET (and are familiar with the *DateTime* and *DateTimeOffset* objects) you probably hate the built in JS *Date*. *DateTime* and *DateTimeOffset* not only make it easy to parse and format dates and times, but also allow you to do operations on them, like substracting dates, adding an offset to a date etc.
