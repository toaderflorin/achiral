It wasn't that long ago when developers were using tables to format their web pages. Although we all know that's "wrong", 
if you ask developers to point out why it's wrong, you will get a myriad of answers and a lot of them actually won't 
know what to actually say. We'll get to that in a minute, but first, let's start with a brief history of HTML. HTML was 
designed mainly for flowing text articles. It had paragraphs, headings and so forth. It also had hyperlinks, so you could 
click on one and that would take you to another article. 

*This means that an html page is vertically biased, and this is an important distinction to make. It's designed to flow vertically, 
but NOT horizontally.*
